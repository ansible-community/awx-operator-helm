# Ansible project documentation

> A website built from this template is available on [ReadTheDocs](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/ansible-project-template/en/latest/).

> Your feedback is very welcome! Please help us improve the docsite template by opening an issue or submitting a pull request in [the project's repository](https://github.com/ansible-community/project-template).

> After you define the exact structure of the project's docsite, update `mkdocs.yml` file in the root directory correspondingly.

> Provide a mission statement or a brief summary of the Ansible project and why someone would want to use it. It should be two or three sentences long, for example:

At the `PROJECTNAME`, our mission is to produce and maintain simple, flexible,
and powerful open-source software tailored to `PROJECT_PURPOSE`.

We welcome members from all skill levels to participate actively in our open, inclusive, and vibrant community.
Whether you are an expert or just beginning your journey with Ansible and `PROJECT_NAME`,
you are encouraged to contribute, share insights, and collaborate with fellow enthusiasts!

> Please take a look at the files in the [docs](https://github.com/ansible-community/project-template/tree/main/docs) directory and populate them with relevant information. Depending of your project complexity, you can add additional sections; for example, a separate Getting started guide and so on.
