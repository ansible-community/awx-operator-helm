# PROJECTNAME $version Porting guide

You can automatically generate porting guides with [antsibull-changelog](https://pypi.org/project/antsibull-changelog/).  
If you manually create your porting guides, they should include all information a user needs to migrate from one version of your project to another, plus all the new features and changes. 
Porting guides should also provide a link to release changelogs.
