## Code of conduct

Please read and abide by the [Ansible Community Code of Conduct](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html) in all interactions with the community.

## Reporting bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue at <https://github.com/ansible-community/awx-operator-helm/issues>.

Please also include the following information in your issue:

- Your operating system name and the output of `helm show chart awx-operator/awx-operator`
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

## Writing code

Want to fix a bug or implement a feature?
Great!

Look through the [list of issues](https://github.com/ansible-community/awx-operator-helm/issues) for bugs and features.
You can filter bugs with the `bug` label and features with the `enhancement` label.
Any issue that has the `help wanted` label is available to work on.

Please assign yourself to the issue or add a comment to the issue and ask someone to assign it to you.
We can then remove the `help wanted` label.
That will let others know you're working on it to avoid duplicate work or conflicting pull requests.

## Writing documentation

We encourage you to share your expertise with others in the community.
Writing documentation is a great way to do that.

We can also use help fixing issues with the docs.
Look through the
[list of issues](https://github.com/ansible-community/awx-operator-helm/issues)
for anything with the `docs` label.

Please also refer to the
[Ansible documentation style guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/style_guide/index.html)
when writing or fixing docs.
